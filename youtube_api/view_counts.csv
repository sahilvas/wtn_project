Why are some faces blurred but not others? 
I default to blurring all faces (assuming it’s clear enough you can tell who they are) unless we have permission to not blur. 

More about my Creative Engineering class: This class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life. During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life. The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own. This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer. The class officially starts in early Jan, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested! See you in class! Love, Mark

NANLUX's lights were instrumental for filming with the robotic arm:

Warner Bros. Pictures’ “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” is the newest adventure in the Wizarding World™ created by J.K. Rowling.

Professor Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) knows the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen) is moving to seize control of the wizarding world. Unable to stop him alone, he entrusts Magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) to lead an intrepid team of wizards, witches and one brave Muggle baker on a dangerous mission, where they encounter old and new beasts and clash with Grindelwald’s growing legion of followers. But with the stakes so high, how long can Dumbledore remain on the sidelines?

The film features an ensemble cast led by Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne (“The Theory of Everything”), two-time Oscar nominee Jude Law (“Cold Mountain,” “The Talented Mr. Ripley”), Ezra Miller, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Callum Turner, Jessica Williams, Katherine Waterston, and Mads Mikkelsen.

“Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” was directed by David Yates, from a screenplay by J.K. Rowling & Steve Kloves, based upon a screenplay by J.K. Rowling. The film was produced by David Heyman, J.K. Rowling, Steve Kloves, Lionel Wigram and Tim Lewis. Neil Blair, Danny Cohen, Josh Berger, Courtenay Valenti and Michael Sharp served as executive producers.

The film’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography George Richmond (“Rocketman,” “Kingsman: The Golden Circle”), three-time Oscar-winning production designer Stuart Craig (“The English Patient,” “Dangerous Liaisons,” “Gandhi,” the “Harry Potter” and “Fantastic Beasts” films) and production designer Neil Lamont (“Solo: A Star Wars Story,” “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”), four-time Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (“Chicago,” “Memoirs of a Geisha,” “Alice in Wonderland,” “Fantastic Beasts
and Where to Find Them”), and Yates’ longtime editor Mark Day (“Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,” the last four “Harry Potter” films). The music is by nine-time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard (“News of the World,” “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,” “Defiance,” “Michael Clayton,” “The Hunger Games” films).

Warner Bros. Pictures presents a Heyday Films Production, a David Yates film, “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,” in theaters internationally beginning 7 April 2022 and in North America on April 15, 2022. The film will be distributed worldwide in select theatres and IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures."	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9dr2zw-TXQ/default.jpg	120	90	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9dr2zw-TXQ/mqdefault.jpg	320	180	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9dr2zw-TXQ/hqdefault.jpg	480	360	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9dr2zw-TXQ/sddefault.jpg	640.0	480.0	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9dr2zw-TXQ/maxresdefault.jpg	1280.0	720.0	Warner Bros.
